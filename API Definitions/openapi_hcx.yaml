        - Coverage Eligibility APIs
      description: >-
        This API is for providers to check the eligibility of a beneficiary with the payors via HCX. This API should be used to request whether the patient's coverage is in force, whether it is valid at this or specified date, and/or for requesting the benefits & plan details associated with the coverage. 
         
         Providers should send the following details in the request body while making a call for coverage eligibility check:
         1. A set of header attributes that provide transport, security, message integrity and summary information about the message being exchanged. This information is used by the HCX gateway for routing the request and auditing purposes.
         2. Domain payload containing the CoverageEligibilityRequest domain entity (eObject) as prescribed for the use case by the [domain specifications](https://docs.swasth.app/hcx-specifications/hcx-domain-specifications/domain-data-specifications/domain-data-models/eobjects#coverage-eligibility-request). This needs to be encrypted so that HCX cannot read this and can be decrypted & processed only by the intended recipient.
        
        The domain payload should be a [CoverageEligibilityRequest document](https://docs.swasth.app/hcx-specifications/hcx-domain-specifications/domain-data-specifications/domain-data-models/eobjects#coverage-eligibility-request) resource as per [HCX FHIR profile definitions](https://swasth-digital-health-foundation.github.io/standards/output/StructureDefinition-CoverageEligibilityRequestDocument.html) (an extension of HL7 FHIR). The domain payload should be a FHIR bundle of type document and should have the following elements:
        
          - The document composition type should be a code representing Coverage Eligibility Request document type.
          - The document composition should have a single entry refering to a CoverageEligibilityRequest resource.
          - The document must contain a [CoverageEligibilityRequest](https://swasth-digital-health-foundation.github.io/standards/output/StructureDefinition-CoverageEligibilityRequest.html) resource as the HCX FHIR profile definition.
          - The document should contain a Patient resource with minimal required information about the patient.
          - The document should contain one or more Coverage resources with minimal information of the policy about which the information is requested.
        
        
        The CoverageEligibilityRequest document FHIR resource created as per the HCX FHIR profile should be encrypted and sent in the request body along with the set of attributes that are open for consumption by the HCX gateway. 
        
        
        The request body (header attributes and the FHIR document) should be sent in the form of a JWE token ([RFC-7516](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516)) serialized using [Flattened JSON Serialization](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516#section-7.2.2).
        
        Refer to the JWEPayload schema definition for details & structure of the JWE token that has to be sent as the request body in this API.
        
        
        The response to this API could be one of the following:
          1. A successful accepted response from the HCX gateway if the strucuture of the request is valid and the validation of open attributes (protocol headers) is successful. Upon successful validation, HCX gateway forwards the same request to the intended recipient asynchronously.
          2. An error response if any of the validations fail.
          
        If the request is successfully accepted by the HCX gateway and forwarded to the recipient (i.e. the payor), the provider (who made the Coverage Eligibility Request API call) should expect the response via a call back to Coverage Eligibility Response API asynchronously. The response API payload may either contain the requested coverage details or error details in case of any errors during  processing.
        
        
        An alternate scenario is when the Payor might respond with a redirect instruction asking the Provider to submit the same request to another Payor.

        - Coverage Eligibility APIs
      description: >-
        This API is for payors to send the response for a coverage eligibility request to the providers. In case of a successful scenario, this API payload should contain the eligibility and plan details of the beneficiary for whom the details are requested for.
        
        
        Payors should send the following details as the request payload in the coverage eligibility response API:

          1. A set of header attributes that provide transport, security, message integrity and summary information about the message being exchanged. This information is used by the HCX gateway for routing the request and auditing purposes.
            
          2. If the coverage eligibility request is successfully processed, payor should send a CoverageEligibilityResponse domain entity (eObject) as prescribed for the use case by the [domain specifications](https://docs.swasth.app/hcx-specifications/hcx-domain-specifications/domain-data-specifications/domain-data-models/eobjects#coverage-eligibility-response). This needs to be encrypted so that HCX cannot read this and can be decrypted & processed only by the intended recipient.
          
          3. In some cases, after the coverage eligibility request is received and acknowledged by the Payor, the payor may choose to completely hand over processing of the request to another payor by informing the provider to send (i.e. redirect) the request to the new payor. In this scenario, the payor should send a Communication domain entity containing the redirection instructions as payload in the Coverage Eligibility Response API.
          
          4. In case of errors, the Coverage Eligibility Response API payload should contain the error details. 

        
        In a successful coverage eligibility reponse scenario, the domain payload should contain a [CoverageEligibilityResponse document](https://docs.swasth.app/hcx-specifications/hcx-domain-specifications/domain-data-specifications/domain-data-models/eobjects#coverage-eligibility-response) resource as per [HCX FHIR profile definitions](https://swasth-digital-health-foundation.github.io/standards/output/StructureDefinition-CoverageEligibilityResponseDocument.html). The domain payload should be a FHIR bundle of type document and should have the following elements:
        
          - The document composition type should be a code representing Coverage Eligibility Respoonse document type.
          - The document composition should have a single entry refering to a CoverageEligibilityResponse resource.
          - The document must contain a [CoverageEligibilityResponse](https://swasth-digital-health-foundation.github.io/standards/output/StructureDefinition-CoverageEligibilityResponse.html) resource as the HCX FHIR profile definition.
          - The document should contain one or more Coverage resources with minimal information of the policy about which the information is being returned.
          - The response should contain an InsurancePlan resource with information about the insurance plan/product related to the policy.
        
        
        In a redirect scenario, the payload should contain a Communication FHIR resource with the following details:
          - identifier: unique identifier
          - category: “instruction” 
          - topic: code representing the action “redirection”
          - instantiatesURI: URI of coverage eligibility API
          - about: reference to the original CoverageEligibilityRequest
          - reasonCode: reason for redirection, choose the appropriate code from the redirection reason codes value set
          - payload: string or an attachment with full details about the redirection reason and steps

        
        In case of errors, the error details should be sent in the following manner:
          - Basic details about the error must be sent as part of the header attributes. HCX gateway shall read and store this information for audit & search purposes. Following header attributes should be used for sending the error details:
              - **x-hcx-status** should be set to **response.fail**.
              - **x-hcx-error_details** attribute should be set with the appropriate error code, message and trace details (if available).
          - In case where there are clinical, patient or business related errors, the payor should send exact details of the error to the recipient. These details should not be shared with the HCX gateway and hence, should be sent in encrypted form. Payor should either embed the error details within the CoverageEligibilityResponse resource or  create a Communication FHIR resource and send it as part of the request body.
        
        The CoverageEligibilityResponse document or Communication FHIR resource created as per the HCX FHIR profile should be encrypted and sent in the request body along with the set of header attributes that are open for consumption by the HCX gateway. 
        
        
        The request body (header attributes and the FHIR resources) should be sent in the form of a JWE token ([RFC-7516](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516)) serialized using [Flattened JSON Serialization](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516#section-7.2.2).
        
        Refer to the JWEPayload schema definition for details & structure of the JWE token that has to be sent as the request body in this API.
        
        
        The response to this API could be one of the following:
          1. A successful accepted response from the HCX gateway if the strucuture of the request payload is valid and the validation of open attributes (protocol headers) is successful. Upon successful validation, HCX gateway forwards the same request to the intended recipient asynchronously.
          2. An error response if any of the validations fail.

        - iv
        - ciphertext
        - tag
      type: object
      description: All the HCX protocol APIs require the request body to sent in JWE format (as defined in [RFC-7516](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516)) and formatted using the [Flattened JWE JSON Serialization](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516#section-7.2.2) syntax. Each JWE token should contain the following elements.
      
        1. Protected headers (**protected**) - A set of attributes that provide transport, security, message integrity and summary information about the message being exchanged.
        
        2. JWE element (**encrypted_key**) - Content Encryption Key.
        
        3. JWE element (**iv**) - Initialisation Vector for the algorithm. 
        
        4. JWE element (**aad**) - Additional authentication data.
        
        5. Encrypted Payload (**ciphertext**) - Payload containing the relevant domain entity (eObject) as prescribed for the use case by the domain specifications. This needs to be encrypted so that HCX cannot read this.
        
        6. Authentication tag (**tag**) - Digital signature on the protected header and the payload of the message to ensure its integrity.
        
        
        Detailed steps on how to construct the JWE token are provided in this [section](https://docs.swasth.app/hcx-specifications/hcx-technical-specifications/open-protocol/data-security-and-privacy/message-security-and-integrity#message-encryption) of the HCX specifications.

        encrypted_key:
          type: string
          description: The JWE encrypted key should be generated using the following process
            
            1. A random content encryption key (CEK) has to be generated by the sender. 
            
            2. Encrypt the CEK with the recipient's public key using the RSAES-OAEP algorithm to produce the JWE Encrypted Key.
            
            3. Base64url-encode the JWE Encrypted Key.
          
            
            The encrypted & base64 encoded key should be set as the encrypted_key in the JWE token and also used for encrypting the domain payload (i.e. the FHIR resource) to be sent in the request. The recipient shall decrypt the content encryption key using their private key (corresponding to the public key used by the sender) and use the decrypted CEK for decrypting the domain payload. 
          example: "6KB707dM9YTIgHtLvtgWQ8mKwboJW3of9locizkDTHzBC2IlrT1oOQ"
        iv:
          type: string
          description: Initialization vector (_iv_) is needed in the encryption process of the payload and for the recipient (along with the encrypted_key and aad) to subsequently decrypt the payload. The "iv" should be created by generating a random JWE initialization vector and Base64url-encoding the JWE initialization vector. 
          example: "AxY8DCtDaGlsbGljb3RoZQ"
        aad:
          type: string
          description: Similar to "iv", Additional Authenticated Data (aad) is also needed for encryption and decryption of the payload data. The value of "aad" should be created in the same way the "protected" header is created - 
          
          
            aad = ASCII(BASE64URL(UTF8(JWE Protected Header)))
            
          example: "eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ"
        ciphertext:
          type: string
          description: _ciphertext_ contains the domain payload (that has to  be sent to the recipient) in encrypted form. Usecase specific   JSON payload defined in the [eObjects](https://docs.swasth.app/hcx-specifications/hcx-domain-specifications/domain-data-specifications/domain-data-models/eobjects) section of the HCX specifications (i.e. the FHIR resource defined for the use case, e.g. CoverageEligibilityRequest document for coverage eligibility request API) should be encrypted as per JWE specification and sent as the _ciphertext_ in the request.
          
          
            Steps to create the ciphertext element - 
            
            1. Create the JSON payload for the API request as per the [eObjects specification](https://docs.swasth.app/hcx-specifications/hcx-domain-specifications/domain-data-specifications/domain-data-models/eobjects).
            
            2. Perform authenticated encryption on the JSON payload with the AES GCM algorithm using the CEK as the encryption key (_encrypted_key_), the JWE Initialization Vector (_iv_)), and the Additional Authenticated Data value (_aad_), requesting a 128-bit Authentication Tag output. This step outputs a ciphertext and an authentication tag (_tag_).
            
            3. Base64url-encode the ciphertext output from the previous step and set it as the _ciphertext_ element in the request body.
            
          example: "KDlTtXchhZTGufMYmOYGS4HffxPSUrfmqCHXaI9wOGY"
        tag:
          type: string
          description: The authentication tag generated as an output of the payload encryption algorithm (used for creating the _ciphertext_) should be sent as the _tag_ element in the request body. This tag is required for decrypting the encrypted payload.
          example: "Mz-VPPyU4RlcuYv1IwIvzw"
    
    ProtectedHeader:
      type: string
      description: Protected headers contain information that helps HCX gateway to identify senders, receivers of the message, perform integrity checks, audits and routing functionality. Header values are posted in clear and must never contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about the patient or any person. HCX protocol uses JWE protected headers for such information to ensure these are not tampered with by the intermediate gateways. Protected Headers for HCX will be the union of the following three header categories.
          
            1. JOSE Headers - JSON Web encryption header as per [RFC7516](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516#section-4). For HCX V1, this is proposed to be fixed to {"alg":"RSA-OAEP","enc":"A256GCM"}. Refer to _JOSEHeader_ schema definition for details.
            
            2. HCX Protocol Headers - Private headers as per [RFC7516 section 4.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516#section-4.3). List of header values that are allowed in HCX APIs and their details are defined in this [section](https://docs.swasth.app/hcx-specifications/hcx-technical-specifications/open-protocol/key-components-building-blocks#hcx-protocol-headers) of HCX Specifications. Refer to _ProtocolHeader_ schema definition for details.
            
            3. HCX Domain Headers - JSON object containing a map of domain-specific header values as proposed in domain data specifications for each entity. E.g. For claims use cases, domain specs may decide to populate the total claimed amount, list of diagnostics/procedures. Please note that all such parameter names must follow the naming convention _x-hcx-<use_case_name>-<parameter_name>_. Refer to _DomainHeaders_ schema definition for details.
            
            
          Overall, the protected headers should be created as - <br/>
            JWE Protected Header = BASE64URL(UTF8( (JOSE headers) + (HCX Protocol Headers) + (HCX Domain Headers) ))
